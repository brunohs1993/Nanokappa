# Modules used in the library:
# h5py         --> to read hdf5 files
# phonopy      --> to make atomic calculations whenever needed
# imageio      --> to draw simulation animations
# trimesh      --> to deal with complex geometries
# pyembree     --> for fast ray-mesh intersections calculation. Easy to install on Linux, tricky on windows.

# triangle     --> soft dependency of trimesh
# rtree        --> trimesh dependency
# shapely      --> trimesh dependency
# scikit-learn --> for AI models
