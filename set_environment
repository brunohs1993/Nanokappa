# Script to create the environment and install all needed packages

# Modules used in the library:
# h5py     --> to read hdf5 files
# trimesh  --> to deal with complex geometries
# pyiron   --> to read atomic structure - CHECK IF REALLY NEEDED
# phonopy  --> to make atomic calculations whenever needed
# pyembree --> for fast ray-mesh intersections calculation. Easy to install on Linux, tricky on windows.
# rtree    --> trimesh requirement
